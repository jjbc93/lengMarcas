                    <td><dd>
                        <li>Added `controlbar´attribute to `flashvars´ so that the Flash player no longer needs a different height than the HTML5 video</li>

                    <td><dd>
                        <li>Removed the poster attribute from the video element as the iPhone OS has a nasty bug that will cause any HTML5 video                                   element(not just VfE) that uses multiple `<source>´ tags to fail whenever the page is refreshed. A fix is coming with iPhone OS                             4.0; encode the poster as the first frame of the video as a workaround</li>
                        <li>Changed `<source´...></source>´back to <source.../>`for valid HTML5.</li>
                        <li>Added support for WebM/VP8</li>
                        <li>Changed Flash to use a `flashvars´ parameter instead of appending to the SWF location for simplicity (with thanks to videojs                           for demostrating this)</li>

                            Only iPhone OS 2.0 support was lost (for inpage playing, download link will still work)</li>

                        <li>Fixed an element closure bug with the osurce tags in Firefox 3.0/Camino 2.0.
                            Thanks goes to Terrell Kelley for spotting this</li>

                            This was done for much smaller code and better compatibility with Opera</li>
